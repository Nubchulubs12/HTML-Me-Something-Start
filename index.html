            The early years
         </h1>
         <p>
            When I was 16 years old I just got my first car, which was a 1992 ford f:150 inline 6.
            It was a very good truck for a new driver, but that wasn't enough for me. I began
            to find myself wanting more out of it. My parents didn't know it then but that was the 
            beginning of their nightmare, from being outside working on it to dealing with 
            neighbors that complained about the loud noises coming from the exhaust.

            Highschool years
         </h1>
         <p>
            Throughout highschool I wanted to start mess with different cars or trucks, ive gotten tired of how
            my current truck was. It had reached its limits with what i could or wanted to do with it.
            So it was time to move on from it and part ways. As a highschool kid with a minimum wage job, I sold the 
            truck and bought something I didn't think i would ever want(a gas saver..). I had bought a 2001 saturn SL2.
            I was very good on gas but yet again the little tinker/car enthusiast wanted more out of it.
            I got snap on hub caps on it, I put a big "WANG" on it. It was a blast to neutral drop it to see some tire smoke 
            and to just ride with friends in doing dumb stuff with it.

            Senior year
         </h1>
         <p>
            My last year of highschool has finally come to. With that being said so has my time with the good old saturn.
            Yet again it was time to move on to another, this next one was changed me for life. My grandpa had a 2000 durango that I 
            got from him, it had the 360ci v8 in it with 3rd row seats and the perfect color blue in the world(to me).
            It was a major change because I was use to the small saturn gas saver and now I have a big v8 that sucks on gas like I did 
            with soda. This big beatuful beast had my heart. It had tons of power for senior me. I tried racing buddies with it I attempeted 
            to off-road it many times. I strike again with modifying it for more power with cold air intake, doing a muffler delete.

            Calm before the storm
         </h1>
         <p>
            After highschool I went to college for automotive. There I learned how to measure, build and test engines. 
            I loved it, I learned how to fix almost everything on a vehicle from the ground up. With the start of college and gas prices increasing 
            (for that time ), I decided to sell the almighty durango and buy my dads car which was a 2008 scion xb. This wasn't no v8, it was a tiny 
            4cyl with a slap stick style shifter. I was very surprised that this car was quick and as fun to drive as the durango. This cube like car
            say many and I mean many changes. It had plasti dip put on it, a hood scoop, lights on the inside and a cold air intake with the last mod 
            bing a muffler swap. After all that was done this thing was a sight to behold and sounded great for a 4cyl car. I was very proud to drive it 
            and to haul friends in it to go places.

               While colleges end begins to approach and I still had some college loan money around, I took a big leap for myself. 
               I bought a 1984 camaro z28! This car need some work of course but the v8 love i had still was burning deep in me.
               It was a 5spd manual with a 305ci v8. This car was fun to drive, cruise in and most of all do burnouts in.
               It had my heart(event till this day). After to many burnouts I blew the engine in it. So with my new knowledge from college 
               I decided to rebuild the engine. I got a 355 block, put a cam in it and a new clutch for the transmission along with 4:10 gears for 
               the rear end. At last I have created a mad thumping monstrosity! I showed this car off to everyone I knew, it was loud fast 
               and just crazy to know I put my knowledge to the test and was able to make this car the way I wanted, well thought I 
               wanted(ill get into that later). The last thing to make this car better was to do a paint job that was very unique.

               After college I was now ready for the world, though I thought. With no more schooling came getting a full-time job, and along 
               with that came bills. My bills my have been more than some other people for my age, and I wasn't making enough to pay them so the 
               next best thing was to sell my beloved camaro.. It was sold and no more v8 heavenly power. I went years without a second car that was fun, 
               but through those years i got a better paying job a new daily( 2014 ram hemi). The new daily was what i was missing. Back to v8 heaven, 
               I modded and tuned the truck to make it fun just like the camaro i had was. I took the truck to the track to try and get the rush of speed 
               and power that the 1984 camaro had, sadly it just didn't fill that void i had in me.

               On the horizon
            </h1>
            <p>
               With taking the truck to the track i fell in love with drag racing! I was in a financally good spot in my life that one last ditch 
               effort to try and reclaim what i lost when i sold my camaro(AMERICAN FREEDOM and BALD EAGLE SREAMIN). I found a camaro, same 
               body style as my last one but it was a 1990 year. It had a 355 with a th350 automatic transmission, it was a peppy car that sounded good when 
               cruising in it. I took the car to the drag strip, and it was fast but wasnt the same as the first camaro. I decided i had to build another 
               engine to get the thrill i longed desired. I got a 350ci engine put a mild cam in it, and just like that i had a fast car made for racing.
               The new camaro was starting to fill the void i had from the last camaro i had. But as soon as i was getting close, I made one last pass for one of the 
               nights i was at the drag strip and the engine blew up throwing a rod out the block on the last pass. I didnt get hurt, but i knew this wasnt
               the end of my journey to fill the void i have. So currenttly i have made a slight revision to the car.

               This year so far I have buckled down and swapped the blown motor from my 1990 camaro and put in a cammed 345 hemi into it along 
               with a dodge automatic transmission. It was long and hard to custom make the parts I needed, but I finally have it running. All I have to 
               do is drive it and take it to the track to make me complete because I know this car now has everything and more to do so.
